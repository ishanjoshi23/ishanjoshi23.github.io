											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I aim to drive innovation through the power of computing.<br>
											I am an Engineering Student in the Faculty of Applied Science at the 
											University of British Columbia (UBC) pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering. <br>
											I am interested in learning about computer architecture and computing systems. 
											I am a quick learner and am motivated to succeed in all my tasks. 
											<br> Having completed internships in the past, 
											I am well-rehearsed in professional development practices, tools, and working with a team. 
											Further, through my extracurricular experiences, I have gained and developed strong leadership, interpersonal, 
											and technical skills that are beneficial in the workplace. <br>
											I recently completed an 8 month Internship at NETINT Technologies as a Firmware Test Engineer. My role was to work with 
											a small team to develop and maintain new automation test scripts to test the firmware of the company's products. This included 
											adding support for new features as well as fixing bugs for existing features.  
											I also had the opportunity to work with hardware and perform hands-on tests on the company's products. <br> 
											I have also worked on several projects, some of which involve Full-Stack Development, while others are more tailored to 
											hardware development processes. In my free time, I enjoy playing Cricket and spending time outdoors! 
											Feel free to connect with me to learn more or if you want to have a chat about opportunities in the industry!</p>
